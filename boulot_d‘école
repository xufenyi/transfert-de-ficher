Today, over 3800 undergraduate freshmen gather and participate in the Opening Ceremony in Tsinghua University. They wear uniform clothes of each department, making the gymnasium blossom with vivid colors.
The whole ceremony is filled with sense of belonging. Singing aloud the school anthem, putting on the school badge, resonating with the speech… All these moments remind the freshmen that they are already a member of the big Tsinghua family.
During the ceremony, some teachers and senior students deliver speeches, sharing their experiences and conveying their aspirations. Most importantly, they call for everyone to adhere to the Tsinghua spirit as “self-discipline and social commitment”.
Let’s give our warmest welcome and sincere congratulations to the freshmen again. May they go steadily in the outcoming journey of college.
